💡This datapack handles all world generation configuration to integrate the different mods adding biomes and structures.

It does that by introducing a range of exclusion/avoid tags on a per-mod basis.
These sets are included in all/most structure files of the individual mods.

For example:
All structures from "Dungeons Arise" have an exclusion zone for vanilla villages, sky villages, and a range of vanilla Minecraft structures (e.g. jungle temples).
This avoids any hostile structures spawning (too) close to villages and other (traditional) landmarks.

💡This datapack also disables the spawning of some structures that are not in line with the server vision (or pose a conflict with another mod).

💡Finally, this datapack updates the biome tag files of all structure mods to account for the range of biome mods in this pack.

As the datapack is now hosted on github, no changelog will be provided in .TXT format.
